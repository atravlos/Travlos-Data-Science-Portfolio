# Welcome to my Basic Streamlit App!

This is my first ever app created with Streamlit. This is a very simple app that includes interactive features to filter through a sample penguins dataset based on species and bill length. My hope is in the future to return to this app and make improvements/advancements to it!

## ✍️ Instructions
1. In terminal, navigate to working directory and run "streamlit run main.py". The app will open in the local browser. Or you can search for the app on streamlit community cloud.
2. The app is all yours! Choose a species from the dropdown or a bill length range to filter through!

## 🔢 Data

Inside the data folder, you will find a penguins.csv file that contains various penguins species, bill lengths, bill depths, and other features. The data was gathered by Kristen Gorman as part of the Palmer Station, Antarctica , Long-Term Ecological Research Program (LTER).
