## Data
- This project uses an adapted dataset from the ["Global/All Medalists" Dataset by Giorgio Comai](https://edjnet.github.io/OlympicsGoNUTS/2008/). This dataset contains extensive information regarding the medal-winning athletes at the 2008 Summer Olympics which includes the country the athlete represented and place of birth. The adapted dataset I use in this project only contains basic information such as the name of the athlete, event they participated in, gender, and medal awarded.
