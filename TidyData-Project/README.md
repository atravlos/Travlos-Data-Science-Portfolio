## Data

- Name, gender, event, and medal data from a csv file that was adapted from ["Global/All Medalists" Dataset by Giorgio Comai](https://edjnet.github.io/OlympicsGoNUTS/2008/). The original dataset contains additional information including country represented and place of birth.

## Approach

- Method chaining to melt, rename, and sort data by medal awarded per event and gender.
- Aggregate and visualize data to evaluate medals awarded by event and gender.
