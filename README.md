## Data Science Portfolio ##

This portfolio is a summary of my work in my Introduction to Data Science Course.

 ## Projects ##

Check out my work throughout the semester in the [Data-Science-Portfolio Repository](https://github.com/atravlos/Travlos-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#data-science-portfolio) or at the following links:

[**Basic Streamlit App**](https://github.com/atravlos/Travlos-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app#welcome-to-my-basic-streamlit-app)

This project uses streamlit to build a dashboard that allows users to filter and observe data from the "Palmer Penguins" dataset.

>**Skills and Libraries**
>>- Streamlit
>>- Pandas

[**Exploring Tidy Data Principles through 2008 Summer Olympic Medalists**](https://github.com/atravlos/Travlos-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project#exploring-the-2008-summer-olympics-medalists)

This project incorporates data wrangling and cleaning to transform a dataset to conform with Tidy Data Principles (Each variable is in its own column, each observation forms its own row, and each type of observational unit forms its own table). Additionally, this project performs exploratory data analysis through the evaluation of medal counts by gender and by event. Whereas the Basic Streamlit App allows a user to filter and observe data, this project guides a user through data wrangling and data visualization to answer a question and tell a story.

[**Interactive Supervised Machine Learning Classifier**](https://github.com/atravlos/Travlos-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/ee65e26c19b47c4db50047d43602be39b2af9a71/MLStreamlitApp)

This project is an interactive supervised machine learning classifier that allows the user to upload a dataset (or choose from the samples provided), walk through data preprocessing steps, and perform and evaluate either a K-Nearest Neighbor or Decision Tree Model. Users are invited to explore with the machine learning model setup by choosing different target/feature columns and tuning hyperparameters (k, max depth, minimum sample splits, etc.) to see how these factors effect model performance. Finally, users will be able to evaluate their model with cross-validation (GridSearchCV), confusion matrices, and classification reports.

>**Skills and Libraries**
>>- Supervised Machine Learning (K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees)
>>- One-Hot Encoding
>>- Machine Learning Model Evaluation (GridSearchCV, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Accuracy, Recall, F1 Score)
>>- Hyperparameter Tuning
>>- Pandas
>>- Matplotlib
>>- Sklearn
